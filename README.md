Thesis: We hypothesize that as weather conditions impact the levels of crime. We suggest that the impact weather has on crime is not consistent amongst all types of crime, with some crime increasing when weather conditions encourages individuals to stay home(domestic violence) and other crime decreases when weather conditions encourage individuals to stay home (home burglary)
Research supporting our hypothesis: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249622050_An_Analysis_of_the_Relationship_between_Weather_and_Aggressive_Crime_in_Cleveland_Ohio
Premise: We are investigating the effects weather has on crime. We will be creating a dashboard that shows several visualizations (listed below.) We will use historical data for both crime and weather data, and develop a model that will predict the level of crime based on the weather. We will do a validity check of our model comparing to the most recent available data to see how well our model predicts the level of crime. We will store our crime data in an SQL database
Visualizations: Map that shows changes of crime over time
Visualizations: Predict each type of crime based on weather conditions
Visualizations: Map with filters of crime type and date that shows clustures of crime in area
Visualizations: A forecast of likelihood of crime occuring based on today's weather
 

Visualizations: Correlation matrix showing crime and weather
 

Data sources: 
Crime Data: Atlanta Police Department Open Data (http://opendataportal.azurewebsites.us/Crimedata/Default.aspx)
Note- crime data gives street and neighborhood, but not zip. We will need to convert to get the lat/lon https://www.gps-coordinates.net/gps-coordinates-converter
Weather Data: Openweather API
